### Hey everyone It's Steepy here, and there is my Open Sourced Filament Dryer Mark One.
The Box is kind of ugly but the project is still in his Beta phase but if someone want to make it  better he can ! All the files are posted and also my CAD file (fusion 360).

### the electronic schematic can be found [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ahP5V3AsNab).

### If you want to make it you will need:
- a 3D printer
- a laser cutter
- PETG or any High melting point filament
- all the parts listed 

### The parts are :
- 5mm plywood
- locks : the design I made is based on theses locks because i got [these](https://www.amazon.fr/AMANMAN-Loquets-Fermeture-Poitrine-Verrouillages/dp/B09ND87N6S/ref=sr_1_31?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3156350S6NBJG&keywords=fermoir+boite+petite&qid=1664376546&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjkyIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=fermoir+boite+petit%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-31) in my storage but if you have others feel free to design your own support :D
- An Arduino Nano
- A heatbed (in my case a Ender 5 one)
- a LCD Screen
- A 250K ohm potentiometer
- A power supply with enough power for the bed (in my case the power supply from my ender 5)
- a transformator to power the Arduino
- a lot of M3 Screws and nuts

### You will need to print :
- 6 times the bracket part
- 2 times the hinge part CAUTION ONLY BUILDPLATE SUPPORT IF NEEDED
- 2 times the Lock support Door side
- 2 times the Lock support Case side

### You will need to laser cut:

- 2 times the Top&under 
- 1 time the right&left 
- 1 time the right&left with wire holes 
- 1 time the back 
- 1 time the door 

What is planed ?
=============
### There is a lot of things planed on this project:
- add a Hygrometric system
- add a Timer System
- upgrade the esthetic
- upgrade the lock and hinge
- upgrade the whole case (easier to make and assemble less screws)
